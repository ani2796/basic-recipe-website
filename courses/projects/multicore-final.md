# Parallel Computation Model - Final Project

[[Project Page]]({{ site.data.multicore.project.page }}){:target="_blank"}

## Algorithm Implementations

Here are some algorithm implementations to which we will apply the developed model as well as prior established models.  
We will look at **matrix multiplication** and **sorting**.

### Matrix Multiplication Algorithms

Here are a few algorithms:
- Regular matrix multiplication
- Cannon's method
- Fox's method
- Block striped decomposition



### Sorting Algorithms
